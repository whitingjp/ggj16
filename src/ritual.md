The Ritual Ritual (TODO: REAL TITLE)
=========

What is this?
-------------

This is a game to create a ritual. As a group you will decide what your ritual
is about, and then, with guidance from the game, create and perform a ritual
together.

You will need at least one player, a deck of cards, and a copy of these rules.

Setup
-----

The first thing you will need to do as a group is to decide what you want to
make a ritual about and the occasion when it is to be performed. It could be a personal greeting for a secret society, a performance before enjoying a favourite meal, a ritual for brushing your teeth, or something that happens everytime you sneeze. The ocasion could be something rare and special, an everyday event or something that happens every thirty seconds. These decisions will determine the feel of the game.

Bootstrap
---------

Remove all the cards from the deck except the clubs. Shuffle the cards, draw a card from the top and look up the meaning associated with that card in the bootstrap table. Read the meaning aloud to all the players. The first part of a ritual described by a player that is consitent with the meaning is added to the ritual. Repeat this process two more times so that a total of three meanings from the boot strap table have been incorporated into the ritual.
