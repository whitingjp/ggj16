The Ritual Ritual (TODO: REAL TITLE)
=========

What is this?
-------------

This is a game to create a ritual. As a group you will decide what your ritual
is about, and then, with guidance from the game, create and perform a ritual
together.

You will need at least one player, a deck of cards (including a Joker), and a
copy of these rules.

Define the Scope
----------------

The first thing you will need to do as a group is to decide what you want to
make a ritual about. It could be a personal greeting for a secret society, a
performance before enjoying a meal or a ritual for brushing your teeth.

Your ritual should be attached to a particular occasion.  Maybe this is
something frequent and quick, every minute that passes, but it could also be
something infrequent or slow, something that occurs once a week, or once a year.
You might consider trying a faster occasion and shorter ritual first, to try and
get a feel how it works.

Once you have decided these things you should collectively have some idea of the
flavour of your ritual, but little idea of its content. The game should help you
figure out what the ritual is.

Setup
-----

Take your deck of cards. Remove all the clubs, these make up the Creation deck.
The rest of the cards make up the Development deck.

Shuffle both decks. Remove eight cards from the Development deck, shuffle the
Joker in with these. Place them all at the bottom of the Development deck.

Creation
--------

First you need to establish an initial ritual, don't worry about getting this
bit 'right', it will change as you play. You should perform this creation step
immediately before performing the ritual for the first time.

Create your ritual in three steps. In each step you will draw a Creation card
and add two contrasting parts to the ritual. The parts you add could be vocal,
physical, symbolic, a combination of the above, or something completely
different. Ideally the parts will relate to the theme in some way, and will be
appropriate for the timescale of your occasion.

For each phase:

* A player draws a card from the smaller Creation Deck.
* They look up the in the Creation table below and read it's text aloud.
* All players silently try to think of two ritualistic parts to add to the
ritual. They should suit the contrast described.
* The first player to think of a pair announces that. They describe their idea
to the group, and this becomes part of the ritual.

Once the three phases are complete you should have a proto-ritual ready to
perform.
