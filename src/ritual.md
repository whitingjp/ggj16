Creative Riting
===============

What is this?
-------------

This is a game to create a ritual. As a group you will decide what your ritual
is about, and then, with guidance from the game, create and perform a ritual
together.

You will need at least one player, a deck of cards (including a Joker), and a
copy of these rules.

Define the Scope
----------------

The first thing you will need to do as a group is to decide what you want toC
make a ritual about. It could be a personal greeting for a secret society, a
performance before enjoying a meal or a ritual for brushing your teeth.

Your ritual should be attached to a particular occasion.  Maybe this is
something frequent and quick, every minute that passes, but it could also be
something infrequent or slow, something that occurs once a week, or once a year.
You might consider trying a faster occasion and shorter ritual first, to try and
get a feel how it works.

Once you have decided these things you should collectively have some idea of the
flavour of your ritual, but little idea of its content. The game should help you
figure out what the ritual is.

The final thing you need to decide is an appropriate method of selecting a
player after the ritual has been performed. This person will be responsible for
making some small modification to the ritual ready for the next time it is
performed. Some simple methods that might work are taking turns or drawing
straws. Another possibility is each player drawing a card from the Creation
deck, highest card acts. The only important thing to consider is that the method
of selection is appropriate to the occasion of the ritual. Pick something easy.

Setup
-----

Take your deck of cards. Remove all the clubs, these make up the Creation deck.
Shuffle the rest of the cards and draw thirteen of them. These make up the
Development deck.

Remove five cards from the Development deck, shuffle the Joker in with these.
Place these all at the bottom of the remaining Development deck.

Shuffle the Creation Deck.

Creation
--------

First you need to establish an initial ritual, don't worry about getting this
bit 'right', it will change as you play. You should perform this creation step
immediately before performing the ritual for the first time.

Create your ritual in three steps. In each step you will draw a Creation card
and add two contrasting parts to the ritual. The parts you add could be vocal,
physical, symbolic, a combination of the above, or something completely
different. Ideally the parts will relate to the theme in some way, and will be
appropriate for the timescale of your occasion.

For each phase:

* A player draws a card from the smaller Creation Deck.
* They look up the in the Creation table below and read it's text aloud.
* All players silently try to think of two ritualistic parts to add to the
ritual. They should suit the contrast described.
* The first player to think of a pair announces it. They describe the parts
to the group, and this becomes part of the ritual.

Once the three phases are complete you should have a proto-ritual ready to
perform. If you think you might struggle to remember by the time the next
occasion comes around, feel free to record it in some way, no need to be
precise.

___NOW PERFORM THE RITUAL___

Development
-----------

Every time the ritual is performed a player will make some sort of change it.
After the ritual has completed, use the selection method determined while
defining the ritual's scope to pick one player.

This player:

* Draws a card from the Development deck.
* Reads the card out to the other players.
* Decides on a change relating to the card to make to the ritual.
* Describe their idea to the group.

The next time the ritual is performed it is changed in the described way. Again,
if you need to record this, feel free.

Continuing to Play
------------------

From now on perform the ritual whenever the occasion is appropriate. Afterwards
perform a Development step as before.

When the Joker card is drawn from the deck the ritual is complete. The game is
over, however you are encouraged to continue using your completed ritual for as
long as you like.
