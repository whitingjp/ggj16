What is this?
-------------

This is a game to create a ritual. As a group you will decide what your ritual
is about, and then, with guidance from the game, create and perform a ritual
together.

You will need at least one player, a deck of cards (including a Joker), and a
copy of these rules.

Define the scope
----------------

The first thing you will need to do as a group is to decide what you want to
make a ritual about. It could be a personal greeting for a secret society, a
performance before enjoying a meal or a ritual for brushing your teeth.

Your ritual should be attached to a particular occasion. Maybe this is
something frequent and quick, every minute that passes, but it could also be
something infrequent or slow, something that occurs once a week, or once a year.
You might consider trying a faster occasion and shorter ritual first to get a 
feel for how it works.

Once you have decided these things you should have some idea of the
flavour of your ritual, but little idea of its content. The game should help you
figure out what the ritual is.

The final thing you need to decide is an appropriate method of selecting a
player after the ritual has been performed. This person will be responsible for
making some small modification to the ritual ready for the next time. Some
simple methods that might work are taking turns or drawing straws. Another
possibility is each player drawing a card from the Creation deck, highest card
acts. The only important thing to consider is that the method of selection is
appropriate to the occasion of the ritual. Pick something easy.

Setup
-----

Take your deck of cards. Remove all the clubs, these make up the Creation deck.
Shuffle the rest of the cards and draw thirteen of them. These make up the
Development deck.

Remove five cards from the Development deck, shuffle the Joker in with these.
Place these all at the bottom of the remaining Development deck.

Shuffle the Creation Deck.

Creation
--------

First you need to establish an initial ritual, don't worry about getting this
bit 'right', it will change as you play. You should perform this creation step
immediately before performing the ritual for the first time.

Create your ritual in three steps. In each step you will draw a Creation card
and add two contrasting parts to the ritual. The parts you add could be vocal,
physical, symbolic, a combination of the above, or something completely
different. Ideally the parts will relate to the theme in some way, and will be
appropriate for the timescale of your occasion.

For each phase:

* A player draws a card from the Creation Deck.
* They look up the card in the Creation table below and read it's text aloud.
* All players silently try to think of two ritualistic parts. They should 
suit the contrast described.
* The first player to think of a pair announces it. They describe the parts
to the group, and these become part of the ritual.

Once the three phases are complete you should have a proto-ritual ready to
perform. If you think you might struggle to remember by the time the next
occasion comes around, feel free to record it in some way, no need to be
precise.

___NOW PERFORM THE RITUAL___

Development
-----------

After every time the ritual is performed a player will make some sort of change to it.
Use the selection method determined while defining the ritual's scope to pick one player.

This player:

* Draws a card from the Development deck.
* Reads the card out to the other players.
* Decides on a change relating to the card to make to the ritual.
* Describes their idea to the group.

The next time the ritual is performed it is changed in the described way. Again,
if you need to record this, feel free.

Continuing to play
------------------

From now on perform the ritual whenever the occasion is appropriate. Afterwards
perform a Development step as before.

When the Joker card is drawn from the Development deck the ritual is complete.
The game is over, however you are encouraged to continue using your completed
ritual for as long as you like.
